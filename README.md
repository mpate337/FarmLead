Excel sheet explains about all the test cases with automation or manual. Only thing I would like to explain here is that in create account, even valid email id is not accepted therefore I could not perform 2 test cases which are mentioned in excel sheet. I have also attached screenshot of executed testcases. HTML report of test execution is in test-output folder as index.html and emailable-report.html files.

Installing Selenium webdriver for chrome
You should have jdk and eclipse installed but not how to install is also shown in the link.
You have to follow this steps shown in this link. It is better for you to understand using screenshots and links rather than me explaining here that's why I am sending you the links here.

For creating projects you can just use my cloned repository.

Installing testng
After having java, eclipse and selenium webdriver for testng follow this.
https://www.guru99.com/install-testng-in-eclipse.html
After following this, right click on the folder of my repo and go to build path -> configure build path and in library section select testng.

After installing all these, you just have to go to src->example->LoginTest and right click on it and run it as testng test.

If you are stuck anywhere, just ask me any time or at the end google will have the answer!
